# Title: Wine Reviews
# Shor Desc: 130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description

# Context: After watching Somm (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines 
through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan 
to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, 
but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish 
this, please post them!

# Contents: The data consists of 10 fields:
Points: the number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)
Title: the title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage if you're interested in extracting that feature
Variety: the type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)
Description: a few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
Country: the country that the wine is from
Province: the province or state that the wine is from
Region 1: the wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)
Region 2: sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank
Winery: the winery that made the wine
Designation: the vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from
Price: the cost for a bottle of the wine
Taster Name: name of the person who tasted and reviewed the wine
Taster Twitter Handle: Twitter handle for the person who tasted and reviewed the wine
