# DataShelf

buying and selling physical products it deals with buying and selling of datasets, trained
data and other data related to predictive modelling, analytics competitions and data mining.
This is a platform for data scientists, machine learning engineers and data miners where
they can buy and sell their precious data or even can make it open source. They also can
