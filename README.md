# DataShelf

A Data-commerce Site is same as an e-commerce site. The only difference is that instead of
buying and selling physical products it deals with buying and selling of datasets, trained
data and other data related to predictive modelling, analytics competitions and data mining.
This is a platform for data scientists, machine learning engineers and data miners where
they can buy and sell their precious data or even can make it open source. They also can
contribute some data to a particular problem which was generated by someone else. This
platform also provide a competition for the users. The users themselves will generate a
problem with some given raw data, where others can post their trained data by utilizing
those raw data.
