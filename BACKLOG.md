## Niaz

**Task 01:**

First give me a list of features for History page in admin panel. Such as users last login time and others.
After that we will fix what features to select and finally you will develop those in `admin_history.html`
page. The page UI needs to be followed exactly like in `admin_users.html`. CONSISTENCY MATTERS.

## Swarna

Change all the src (source) references in image tag in all the admin html files in roles/admin folder.
Example: change `../res/datashelf_admin_logo.png` to `../../res/admin/datashelf_admin_logo.png`
